#Leftout

by Tony (Andonis) Georgiou

Initialised November 2016.

"LeftOut" is a parody site inspired by the ubiquitous, employment-oriented business/social network, "LinkedIn".

  Despite the comic analogies used in LeftOut (including its cheeky tagline of "The place for creatives who prefer to kick out the corporate ladder rather than climb it") it genuinely seeks to provide an important and valuable network for artistic people that live and work outside of the mainstream corporate world. Many of these highly intelligent and creative people are not on LinkedIn, and maybe they should not be! They need their own specialised site. In this regard LeftOut seeks to provide a global forum for creatives to communicate and share ideas with like-minded people and also allow prospective employers to find people wanting to find specific types and/or periods of work.

  The scrolling sidebar features famous creatives that had to undertake more mundane forms of employment previous to, or during the pursuit of their artistic endeavours in order to "pay the rent". It is there to inspire Users on the hard road to artistic success.

1. Runs on Ruby, version 4.2.7.1 of Rails.
2. Gems used: "bcrypt", "mailboxer" and "will_paginate".
3. "Cloudinary" will be used to import User images.
4. Site has been deployed using Heroku.

##Future Features

1. The "Follow/Followed" will be completed. It may worked more as a reference to contacted Users rather than continual follow feature.
2. An inspiring quote to be added under the carousel of famous creatives.
